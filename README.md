# EZ-Language

## Introduction
EZ-Language (ez) was created by [RedLeZ](https://github.com/redlez) and [vexato](https://github.com/redlez) with the aim of making the development experience easier and more enjoyable.

## Features
Like any programming language, ez has unique features that will make you, dear developer, want to use it:

1. **Environment Declaration**: One of the most powerful and popular key features in ez. You can declare the type of project you want to create using the `env-name;` statement. This feature comes with predefined packages and tools to simplify development in your specified environment. Additionally, you can create your own environment and publish it to our website and env-manager. The statement is usually placed in the `main.ez` file of your project, and you can link other files using `include main.ez`.
2. **Multi-Language Support**: EZ-Language (ez) is designed to be versatile and adaptable, supporting multiple programming languages. Although its core is primarily written in C++, ez integrates features from various languages to provide a seamless development experience. This multi-language support ensures that you can use ez in any project, regardless of the specific language requirements, without worrying about compatibility issues. Whether you are working on a web application, a system utility, or a data analysis project, ez aims to be the perfect tool that bridges the gap between different programming languages and environments.


3. **Everyone is an Ez-team**: EZ-Language (ez) is a project created by the collective effort of the community, for the community. It is a free and open-source project that will always remain open-source. We believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of accessibility. While we welcome support and donations to help sustain and improve the project, we strictly prohibit selling the project or any of its components. Our goal is to ensure that ez remains a tool that anyone can use, contribute to, and benefit from, without any barriers.
